# Feistel playground

This is a dedicated template project for implementing block cipher algorithm with [Feistel structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feistel_cipher).

It contains simple XOR implementation with forward/backward round, single block encryption/decription and ECB/CBC functions (of course you'd replace this with your nice algorithm!).
Unit tests for each phases of encription/ decription written in [gtest](https://github.com/google/googletest) are ready as well.
